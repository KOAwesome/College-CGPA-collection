**Brief Introduction**

Hi everyone today my college released results. We all are curious how much our friend got more than us and all. 
So, I decided to webscrap the site and gather the data of each individual in this way we get more idea and also can 
store for a long time

**Procedure::**
- Install the requirements section by the command
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Now you have all the required packages you can get started. Visit the URL you want to download results for. 
- This procedure uses selenium to automate the process of sending keys and downloading data.
- If you have not already made a list of roll numbers you can use regex to do that. 
- By default we use to create a new excel sheet
- Download your browser web drivers. I will leave a link here.
